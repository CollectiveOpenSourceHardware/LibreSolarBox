## Boxframe assembly
Note: square nuts are not symmetric. When inserting them into T-Slot, keep the upper part outside. See picture [...] to determine the upper side of the nuts.

Create large squre frames first.

* Put larger profiles on the table and put plastic corners in the corners. Check orientation of the profiles. The holes on the side of the upper and the lower profile must be up.
* Insert all necessary square nuts in the T-slots.

 Hint: Use a bolt to push a square nut into a slot.

* Control the placement of corners, screws and squre nuts.
Start with the bottom part.
* Connect a corner to the bottom.
* Connect a side part to the bottom.
* Connect another corner to the bottom.
* Connect another side to the bottom.
* Connect remaining corners and the upper part.
* Connect small T-profiles to a big square frame. The holes on the side of the large frame must be later outside of the box.
* Insert nuts into short profiles. Two nuts into every short profiles on the top of the future box. Four nuts into every short profile on the bottom of the future box.
