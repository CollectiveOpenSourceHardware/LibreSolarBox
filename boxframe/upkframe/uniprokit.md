## The UniProKit 

The UniProKit (Universal Prototyping Kit) project was originated by the wish to have a kind of open universal construction kit available, based on the principles of OpenSource/OpenHardware.

It should resemble the well known '''metal construction sets''' like Meccano/Erector, with basic elements like bars, angles and plates with rows of drilled holes, wheels, flanges, transmission-rods etc., up to more specific elements like stepper motors and linear drives, less toy-like, but more stable and slightly bigger dimensioned.

### Applications

Such a thing would be desirable for all kind of projects, for fast and easy testing of approaches and ideas - just rapid prototyping, or for building smaller machines like a 3D-printer or pcb-router. It could also be used for structural supports and mountings in experiments, or jigs for producing other parts. One can also use it for building assembly groups and modular components in other projects, e.g. a lineardrive-module within a tracking-system of a CSP-project (CSP=concentrating solar power).

The application range is wide and similar like those commercial and aluminium-extrusion-profiles based T-slot-systems often used by engineers, but we dont want to be limited only on such quite expensive system-solutions. It is an important aspect of the UniPro-Kit Sets, that they are consisting mainly of these parts, which are easy and everywhere available, like in the next local hardware store. Or one can make use of materials like aluminum-profiles, which can become DIY-processed with hand-tools and simple jigs, e.g. drilling rows of holes and cutting at different lengths.

It is an important and typical part of the OSE-concept, to become independent of industrial producers, not absolutely and by 100%, but as much as possible.

### Compatibility 

Within the ongoing development of this project eventually occurred - as a kind of by-product - the idea, to make the UniPro-Kit open and extendable towards all directions and to support any possible kind of compatibility with other Open Hardware Construction sets like Gridbeam, OpenStructures and Openbuilds, etc., and to integrate and combine all these and others together into a kind of open standard.

Now we try to define conditions and criteria of a classification-systematics, in which all kind of parts from different other construction sets can become integrated and registered, getting a unique part-no., and act as a common base for a kind of catalog-system or parts-database.

The aim and our hope is, that such parts would be preferred and more often used in many maker-projects, so that it may later results in a kind of independent de-facto-standard of OpenHardware-parts.

### Advantages 

This would offer the following advantages:

* each part that was integrated into this system contains in its database-entry at least a reference on a source of supply and a technical drawing. In some cases there may be also a detailed description how to produce this part on your own with appropriate tools and jigs ("DIY-able").

* in case of some parts which are not so easy to produce some groups or Open Hardware projects may specialize themselves on producing and offering them the Open Hardware Community to buy. This could lead into a small market with independent suppliers ( like "OpenSourceEconomy").

* the parts and their producing-process itself can be optimized by the community and better adopted at the specific demands of the individual Openhardware projects.

* one can create OpenSource-CAD-libraries of the parts, which allow a pure virtual construction, development and optimization of Open Hardware projects by a big developer-community, longtime before its necessary, to spend real money for materials or having access to well equipped workshops.

* the systematics and the database would allow a direct search and access of special parts. That's different compared to sites like thingiverse, on which also exists a lot of useful things, but they are only small organized and less catalog-like, so it needs a time-consuming search to find there the appropriate thing.

### Status 

The recent state of the project is, that we have already fully defined the so called **Basic-Set**, which is appropriate for all kind of structural framing and mounting stuff and provide it for download as part-library **UPKlib V.2**). It is made conesquently in the OpenSource CAD-programm **FreeCAD**, which means it can be exported from there into many important CAD-fileformats like .igs, .stp, .stl etc.

Other sets are under development, like the **LinearDrive Set** for linear motion of cnc-maschine-axis and the **Frame Set**, which contains useful parts for housing, like corner-elements and cover-plates.  

More stes are in preparation, each one related to a certain area or theme, like electronic-pcbs and stepper-motors. Since this is an open system, all kind of useful Sets can be added by time or on demand.  Meanwhile we can use them as working-examples, for discussing and developing different contents and practical aspects of the systematics.

It would be nice and certainly useful for everyone, if such a kind of systematics could be well established as an independent standard of parts and parts lists in Open Hardware projects.  Whether this will really happen or not depends on different facts and influences, like e.g. the acceptance of the community.
